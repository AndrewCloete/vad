# Voice Activity Detection for the Browser

This package aims to provide an accurate, user-friendly voice activity detector that runs in the browser. Currently, it runs [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) in the browser using [ONNX Runtime Web](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/main/js/web).
